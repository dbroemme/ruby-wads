# ruby-wads

A number of Ruby Gosu-based (W)idgets (a)nd (D)ata (S)tructures for your applications.

## Installation

Add this line to your applicationâ€™s Gemfile:

```
gem 'wads'
```
And then run bundle install.

## Sample Application

To see ruby wads in use, run the sample application using the following commands:

```
git clone https://github.com/dbroemme/ruby-wads.git
cd ruby-wads
./bin/setup
./run
./run-sample-app -s
```

This will run the sample NASDAQ stocks analysis that features the use of the 
Stats class, and a table Gosu widget used to display the results of the analysis.

You can also see the graph capabilities by running the Star Wars analysis example.
This uses a data set that captures all character interactions within Episode 4.

```
./run-sample-app -j
```

There is also a sample Graph display using the following command.
```
./run-sample-app -g
```
Note that you can construct graphs in one of two ways. The first approach uses Nodes directly.
```
root = Node.new("a")
        b = root.add("b")
        b.add("d")
        b.add("e").add("f")
        root.add("c")
        Graph.new(root)
```
The second approach uses an overarching Graph object. 
```
g = Graph.new 
g.add("a")
g.add("b")
g.add("c")
g.add("d")
g.add("e")
g.add("f")
g.connect("a", "b")
g.connect("a", "c")
g.connect("b", "d")
g.connect("b", "e")
g.connect("e", "f")
```

Currently, the Graph object is used by the Graph Widget for display. For the code above, this appears by default as follows:
